//
//  CallAudioController.swift
//  Construct Messenger
//
//  Single owner of the call audio-session lifecycle.
//
//  Before this existed, five different sites poked the same global
//  AVAudioSession / RTCAudioSession in a race: WebRTCSession.configureAudioSession
//  (category), CallKitProvider.didActivate (RTC enable), CallManager.onAudioActivated
//  (category AGAIN + setActive + dial tone), CallManager.onConnected/endActiveCall
//  (dial-tone stop), and WebRTCSession.close (setActive(false)). That fragmentation
//  is why audio was silent / echoing / dial-tone-stuck depending on call order.
//
//  Everything that touches the call audio session now flows through here. CallKit
//  and CallManager only *notify* this controller of lifecycle events; this is the
//  only writer to RTCAudioSession.isAudioEnabled and the dial tone.
//
//  Split by isolation: the methods that only touch the thread-safe global
//  AVAudioSession / RTCAudioSession are `nonisolated static` (callable from CallKit's
//  nonisolated delegate callbacks). The ringback-tone + phase state is `@MainActor`
//  instance state, driven from CallManager (already @MainActor).
