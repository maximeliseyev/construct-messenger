//
//  SessionReducer.swift
//  Construct Messenger
//
//  Phase 1 / 1.5 of SESSION_COORDINATOR_REFACTOR_SPEC: the pure, deterministic core of
//  the per-contact session state machine, extracted out of SessionCoordinator's ad-hoc
//  `ContactSessionState` dictionary + the queue disposition that lived inline in
//  MessageRouter.handleFirstMessage.
//
//  Mirrors the proven TransportReducer pattern: side-effect-free functions that return
//  the next state plus a list of effects an effector performs. The reducer NEVER does I/O —
//  no crypto, no gRPC, no Keychain, no Task scheduling, no Date(). All time is injected.
//
//  Two concerns, kept separate on purpose:
//   • `reduce` — the session *phase* lifecycle (initializing / active). SessionCoordinator
//     owns the phase and performs the resulting queue effects.
//   • `incomingDisposition` — the *queue disposition* for an incoming message, a pure
//     decision fed by the authoritative facts MessageRouter holds (Rust session existence +
//     whether init is already underway). It is stateless: the `.initializing` transition
//     stays owned by the init executor (handlePublicKeyBundleNeeded), so it never trips
//     that executor's reentrancy guard.
//
//  Because the logic is pure, it is exercised directly by SessionRaceConditionTests —
//  the tests drive these production functions, not a parallel reimplementation.
