//
//  HybridIdentityService.swift
//  ConstructMessenger
//
//  Phase 1 of PQ-signature protocol integration (client side).
//
//  Publishes the device's hybrid PQ identity bundle (Ed25519 + ML-DSA-65) to the
//  server, decoupled from key rotation:
//    - hybrid identity public key (1984 B), generated lazily on first launch (core-owned);
//    - an Ed25519 cross-signature binding it to the device's existing identity (core signBundle);
//    - hybrid signatures over the CURRENT classic SPK (suite 0x01) and Kyber SPK (0x10).
//
//  Crypto primitives + key ownership (ensure/sign) live in construct-core (KeyManager + CFE).
//  No hybrid signature algorithm lives outside core. The "when to publish / on rotation"
//  policy + downgrade state live here (as designed in the integration plan).
//
//  The server (key-service `store_hybrid_identity`) verifies each signature against
//  the currently stored prekeys and never triggers a rotation. Verification is
//  capability-gated end-to-end: peers without hybrid keys keep working unchanged.
//
//  Binding model: the hybrid key's Ed25519 half is INDEPENDENT of the device
//  identity; the cross-signature is the binding. See
//  decisions/pq-signature-protocol-integration-plan.md.
